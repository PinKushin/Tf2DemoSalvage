# The local merge gate: every test project, one at a time, with the count of each checked.
#
# **Why per project rather than one solution-wide `dotnet test`.** Two reasons, and the second is
# the one that bites.
#
#   - `dotnet test` on the solution runs test ASSEMBLIES concurrently, so Viewer3D.UiTests — which
#     launches the viewer and drives a real window — competes with everything else. Measured
#     2026-08-16: that suite passes in 2 seconds alone and failed one of eight at 10 seconds inside
#     a single-invocation run.
#   - A solution-wide run writes one .trx per project, all with the same file name, so a count check
#     cannot tell them apart. Running one project at a time is what makes the floors below
#     meaningful.
#
# **The floors are the point.** "Passed!" is not the result; the COUNT is. Observed 2026-08-17
# (B104): a solution-wide run reported
#
#     Passed!  - Failed: 0, Passed: 50, Skipped: 0, Total: 50 - Tf2DemoSalvage.Viewer3D.Tests.dll
#
# against a suite of 350, in one second rather than eighty. Nothing in that line is a warning, and
# the floor guarding it at the time was 34 — so the truncation would have passed the check as well
# as the eye. These floors sit just under the real counts for that reason.
#
# Ratcheted rather than exact: adding a test must not redden the build, but removing three hundred
# must. Raise them when the suite grows; lowering one is a decision to state out loud.
#
# **"Test Run Aborted" in the viewer suite is probably the desktop, not the code.** Seen once on
# 2026-08-20: the run died at 192 of 512 and the floor caught it. Viewer3D.Tests creates real D3D
# devices, and at the time another application was in exclusive full screen — the owner's video
# player — which is a known way for device creation to fail. Unproven: it did not reproduce in four
# clean runs afterwards, and nothing was captured from the crash itself.
#
# Worth knowing before chasing it as a defect, and worth noting that this suite is NOT run under
# run-exclusive.ps1 the way the UI suite is, because it takes no desktop of its own — it just wants
# a GPU that nobody else has taken exclusively.
#
# **No --filter here, and that is deliberate.** Passing one changes which tests EXIST, not merely
# which of them run: NUnit's adapter includes [Explicit] tests when no filter is given and drops
# them as soon as any filter is present. Measured on Content.Tests — 441 unfiltered against 436
# with `--filter 'FullyQualifiedName!~UiTests'`, the five being the diagnostic probes. Two
# invocations that look equivalent therefore report different totals, which is the same class of
# trap as the truncation above. Running whole projects one at a time needs no filter at all.

# A floor exists to catch a run that reported success while executing a fraction of the suite —
# a crashed test host does exactly that, and prints "Passed!" with a truncated total. A floor
# with slack in it cannot: core's sat at 1000 against 1163 actual, so 163 tests could vanish
# silently. That is the same defect as B104, where 34 guarded 352.
#
# Set to the exact count, so adding tests keeps passing and REMOVING them fails until the number
# is lowered on purpose. The ratchet is the feature — every lowering should be a deliberate edit
# in the same commit that deleted the tests, which is what makes a silent loss impossible.
