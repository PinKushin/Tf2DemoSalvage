/// <summary>
/// The viewer shell: menu, viewport and status line.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// **WinForms hosts the chrome; Direct3D owns only the viewport.** Menus, a timeline and an
/// entity list are ordinary controls, and drawing them in D3D would mean writing a UI toolkit to
/// avoid using one. The renderer takes the viewport panel's handle and presents into that
/// rectangle, so the two never fight over the same surface.
///
/// **Every control carries an automation id and an accessible name**, because the UI tests are a
/// stated part of this project and a control that automation cannot address is a control that
/// cannot be tested. WinForms exposes both through <see cref="Control.Name"/> — which is what
/// UIA reports as AutomationId — and <see cref="Control.AccessibleName"/>, which is what a screen
/// reader announces. They are different properties and both are needed: the first is a stable
/// identifier that must not be translated, the second is prose that should be.
///
/// The device is created on first paint rather than in the constructor, because a swap chain
/// needs a real handle and the panel does not have one until it is shown. Constructing the form
/// therefore stays free of side effects, which is also what lets it be tested without a display.
